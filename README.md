# NeoVim, Zsh quickstart
Install script works on ubuntu 18.04. Probably works on versions > 16.04, but you may need to update python3

This gets you
- ZIM framework for Zsh with pure and eirner theme
- Neovim with monokai_pro and palenight theme
- Airline with deus theme
- Coc autocompletion
- Sensible, minimal neovim plugins beyond that.
- bat, the enhanced cat replacement
- alias bat for cat, nvim for vim
- git shortcuts, gs, gl for better git status and git logs respectively.
