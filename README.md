# Terminal Fu - NeoVim, Zsh, Colors and more #
Install script works on ubuntu 18.04. Probably works on versions > 16.04, but you may need to update python3

This gets you
- ZIM framework for Zsh with pure and eirner theme
- Neovim with monokai_pro and palenight theme
- Airline with deus theme
- Coc autocompletion
- Sensible, minimal neovim plugins beyond that.
- bat, the enhanced cat replacement
- alias bat for cat, nvim for vim
- git shortcuts, gs, gl for better git status and git logs respectively. 

## Manual Install ##

Instead install theses manualy
- Homebrew (mac)
- python3-dev python3-pip
- neovim
- - ruby, node # needed for coc and jedi autocompletion
- zsh
